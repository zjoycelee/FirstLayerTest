# First Layer Test Models

This repository provides interesting and functional first-layer test models. Unlike existing models that often have no purpose after testing, these models are designed to be useful even after printing.

## Design Philosophy
- Provide meaningful and functional test models.
- Optimize designs for 3D printing efficiency.
