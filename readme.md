# First Layer Test Models

This repository provides interesting and functional first-layer test models. Unlike existing models that often have no purpose after testing, these models are designed to be useful even after printing.

## Current Models

### Mini Card Case (Name Card Holder)
- **Description:** A compact card case that can hold five to six bank cards.
- **Printing Time:** 27 minutes
- **Material Usage:** 12g

### Card Bag for 3 Cards
- **Description:** A small card bag that holds three cards inserted from three directions.
- **Printing Time:** 28 minutes
- **Material Usage:** 7g

## Design Philosophy
- Provide meaningful and functional test models.
- Optimize designs for 3D printing efficiency.

## File Structure
- Each model has its own folder.
- Each model has itss own readme.
- Each folder contains the following subfolders:
  - `assets/`: Stores images related to the model.
  - `stls/`: Stores STL files for the model.
  - `3mf/`: Stores 3MF files for convenience.
